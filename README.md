# GroupProject_387
The goal of this group project is to allow a gym goer to focus on the workout. The project will use either an accelerometer or gyroscope on a glove to monitor weight movement and communicate to a microcontroller using bluetooth that can use the data to count reps. The count will be displayed in addition to a timer which will count both the time since the start of the set and time between the sets. The timer can be set by the user before hand. Finally, the microcontroller will calculate the total volume (reps x sets x weight) and record it to keep track for the user to compare in the future.
